# NOTE: THIS BRANCH IS TO CHANGE THE CURRENT WIP PROJECT FROM IONIC TO REACT

## Reason

Because Angular has made a lot of changes and the changes aren't as friendly to me as a developer than it is, I've decided to go into ReactNative.

# jari2ku 

## Introduction 
This app is built as a digital version to the Jari-Jari Ku book from Unit Pendidikan Khas.

Using [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/), we can easily create a cross-platform app for all to use.

## Development

### Step 1: Change Directory to ```jari2ku```

At the root is just backup files and folders. The real app is in the jari2ku directory. Start development from there.

### Step 2: Setup environment
Set up your environment with ionic's npm with:

```npm install -g ionic cordova```

Note: Might need to use ```sudo``` command.

### Step 3: Test the app

Use ```ionic serve``` after installing and changing something to see it running live.

## Pipeline

* Currently the ionic framework installed version is ```1.7.14```. Planning to upgrade later.
* Add all the images to each individual pages through Angular
* Add "Swipe Right" to save the words into a separate activity page to view a constructed sentence or a list of favorite words for daily use.
